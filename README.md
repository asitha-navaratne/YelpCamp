# YelpCamp

A Yelp clone developed while completing Colt Steele's "Web Development Bootcamp 2022" course on Udemy. Users can create, browse and review campgrounds across a map.

The frontend of this website was developed using EJS and Bootstrap, while the backend was developed using Express with a MongoDB database. Mapbox was used to create the
cluster map which the user can add campgrounds onto. Passport was used for authentication and Cloudinary was used to store the images on the website.
